Name: Tamkien Le


CHANGES:

1. Instead of displaying all categories and supplies at once, I made the links clickable in which supplies swap based off category pressed.
This was said to be fine by the Prof.

2. I made some "changes" in the orginal HTML file by adding more divs inside the provided divs. (for my own organization)
Which was also said to be fine by the prof.
